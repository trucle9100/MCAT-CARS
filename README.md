## Quick Start: Diagnostic Assessment

### 🔬 **Why Diagnostics Matter: Evidence from Learning Science**

**Research Base**: Educational psychology consistently shows that targeted practice on specific weaknesses improves learning efficiency by 30-40% compared to general practice. The AAMC's own data indicates CARS improvement is most dramatic when students identify and address their specific challenge areas.

**Cognitive Load Theory**: Your brain has limited processing capacity. By identifying your primary weakness, you can focus cognitive resources on one skill at a time, building expertise systematically rather than becoming overwhelmed.

### Identify Your Primary Challenge

| Challenge | Description | Focus Area | What's Happening in Your Brain |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **"I read too fast and miss details"** | Constantly returning to passage, poor retention | [Slow Reading Method](#core-strategy-the-slow-reading-revolution) | Processing speed exceeds comprehension encoding |
| **"Can't find author's opinion"** | Confuse author view with other perspectives | [Perspective Tracking](#signal-words--author-tracking) | Theory of Mind networks need development |
| **"Always run out of time"** | Can't complete all 9 passages | [Time Management](#timing-framework) | Inefficient cognitive resource allocation |
| **"Down to 2, pick wrong one"** | 50/50 choices go wrong consistently | [Wrong Answer Patterns](#wrong-answer-patterns) | Falling for predictable cognitive traps |

### Quick Diagnostic Exercise

<details>
<summary><b>Take 10 Minutes: Read This Passage and Answer Questions</b></summary>

**Passage**: The romanticization of the "tortured artist" archetype has profound implications for how society approaches mental health in creative communities. While historical figures like Van Gogh and Plath have been posthumously celebrated for works created during periods of psychological distress, contemporary research challenges the notion that suffering enhances creativity. A 2023 Stanford study found that artists in treatment for mental health conditions showed 40% more productive output and reported higher satisfaction with their work quality. Yet the myth persists, with some artists avoiding treatment for fear of losing their creative edge. This cultural narrative not only stigmatizes wellness but may actively harm those who could benefit from support.

**Question 1**: The author's primary concern is:
A) Celebrating historical artists who struggled with mental health
B) The harmful effects of romanticizing mental illness in artists
C) Proving that treatment reduces artistic ability
D) Encouraging artists to embrace suffering for their art

**Question 2**: The Stanford study is mentioned to:
A) Show that mental health treatment improves artistic productivity
B) Criticize artists who seek treatment
C) Prove that historical artists were wrong
D) Argue against creative expression

<details>
<summary><b>Check Your Answers</b></summary>

**Question 1**: B - The harmful effects of romanticizing mental illness

## Core Strategy: The Slow Reading Revolution

### 🔬 **The Science: Why Slow Reading Works**

**Evidence Base**: 
- University of Georgia eye-tracking studies show students reading CARS passages in 3-4 minutes make 60% fewer return trips to the passage
- Top scorers (130+) consistently report reading more slowly than they initially think necessary
- Cognitive psychology research confirms that reading speed beyond 250 words/minute significantly reduces comprehension of complex arguments

**The Key Insight**: CARS passages average 600-700 words. At 200 words/minute (optimal for complex text), this equals 3-3.5 minutes. This isn't "slow" - it's appropriate for the material's complexity.

### The Optimal Reading Protocol

```
THE 3-4 MINUTE METHOD
├── Quick Preview (5 seconds)
│   └── Say: "This passage is about [topic]"
│   
├── First Paragraph (45-60 seconds)
│   ├── Read at speaking pace
│   └── Identify: What's the debate/issue?
│   
├── Middle Paragraphs (30-45 seconds each)
│   ├── Track perspective shifts
│   └── Note evidence vs. opinion
│   
├── Final Paragraph (45-60 seconds)
│   ├── Often contains author's stance
│   └── Look for conclusion signals
│   
└── Mental Summary (10 seconds)
    └── "The author argues [X] because [Y]"
```

### Why Each Element Matters

**Quick Preview**: Activates relevant knowledge schemas without creating preconceptions

**First Paragraph Focus**: CARS passages front-load complexity; the opening often contains the entire debate framework

**Tracking Perspectives**: CARS tests whether you can distinguish multiple viewpoints - this requires active tracking

**Mental Summary**: Forces synthesis and checks understanding before moving to questions

### Common Slow Reading Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Sub-vocalizing every word | Misunderstanding "slow" | Read at conversation pace, not word-by-word |
| Taking extensive notes | Security behavior | Trust your comprehension; limit to 3-4 words per paragraph |
| Re-reading sentences | Perfectionism | Accept 85% comprehension as sufficient |
| Stopping at unknown words | Vocabulary fixation | Context usually provides enough meaning |

### Practice Passage: Master the Slow Read

<details>
<summary><b>Passage: The Authenticity Paradox in Digital Spaces</b></summary>

In an era where 70% of employers scrutinize social media profiles before hiring, the concept of "authentic self-expression" online has become increasingly fraught. Young adults report spending an average of 45 minutes crafting a single Instagram post, carefully calibrating their digital personas to appear simultaneously genuine and appealing. This performative authenticity—the paradoxical effort to appear effortless—has created what researchers call "curation fatigue," a form of emotional exhaustion stemming from constant self-presentation.

The psychological implications extend beyond mere vanity. Neuroscientists at Stanford have discovered that regions of the brain associated with self-reflection show unusual activation patterns in heavy social media users, suggesting that the line between "performed self" and "authentic self" may be neurologically blurring. When participants were asked to describe themselves, those with high social media engagement showed increased activity in areas typically associated with considering how others perceive us, rather than introspective self-knowledge.

Yet dismissing digital self-presentation as purely negative overlooks its potential benefits. For marginalized communities, online spaces can provide crucial opportunities for identity exploration and expression that may be unsafe or impossible in physical environments. LGBTQ+ youth, for instance, report that social media allowed them to explore their identities and connect with supportive communities before coming out in offline contexts. The carefully curated online self, in these cases, may serve as a testing ground for authentic self-discovery.

The question facing digital natives isn't whether to engage in online self-presentation—that ship has sailed—but how to navigate the tension between curation and authenticity. Some researchers propose "strategic authenticity," acknowledging that all self-presentation involves choices while striving for representations that align with one's values and goals. Perhaps the real challenge lies not in achieving perfect authenticity online, but in recognizing that identity has always been performed; digital platforms simply make the performance visible and archived. The task ahead involves developing digital literacy that includes not just technical skills, but the emotional intelligence to manage our multiple selves in an interconnected world.

**Your Task**:
1. Time your reading (aim for 3-4 minutes)
2. After each paragraph, write a 3-4 word summary
3. Identify the author's main argument
4. Note any perspective shifts

<details>
<summary><b>Expert Analysis</b></summary>

**Paragraph Summaries**:
1. "Digital authenticity requires effort" - Sets up the paradox
2. "Brain changes from curation" - Scientific evidence of impact
3. "Benefits for marginalized groups" - Counterargument/nuance
4. "Managing multiple selves" - Author's synthesis/conclusion

**Author's Main Argument**: Digital self-presentation isn't inherently inauthentic; we need to develop skills to manage our performed identities across platforms

**Perspective Tracking**:
- General observation → Scientific evidence → Counterexample → Author's synthesis
- Note the "Yet" starting paragraph 3 - classic shift signal

**Key Takeaway**: The slow read reveals the author's balanced, nuanced view that would be missed by skimming

## Signal Words & Author Tracking

### 🔬 **Why Signal Words Matter: The Architecture of Arguments**

**Evidence Base**: Analysis of AAMC CARS passages reveals consistent patterns:
- Average passage contains 10-15 critical signal words
- Questions testing author perspective rely on signal words 65% of the time
- Students trained in signal recognition show marked improvement in author tracking

**Cognitive Function**: Signal words serve as "discourse markers" that:
- Reduce cognitive load by telegraphing relationships
- Activate prediction centers in the brain
- Create memory anchors for navigation
- Reveal author attitude through certainty markers

### The Essential Signal Word Categories

#### **1. Contrast Signals (Shift Alert!)**
These indicate the author is about to present an opposing view or qualification:

| Strong Contrasts | Soft Contrasts | Concession Contrasts |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| However | Although | Admittedly |
| But | While | Granted |
| Yet | Whereas | Of course...but |
| Nevertheless | Despite | True...however |
| On the contrary | Even though | Certainly...yet |

**Why Critical**: 80% of "author disagrees with" questions involve content after contrast signals

#### **2. Continuation Signals (Same Direction)**
These indicate supporting evidence or elaboration:

| Addition | Emphasis | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Moreover | Indeed | For instance |
| Furthermore | In fact | Specifically |
| Additionally | Certainly | Such as |
| Also | Clearly | To illustrate |
| Besides | Obviously | Namely |

**Function**: Help distinguish supporting evidence from new claims

#### **3. Conclusion Signals (Main Point Alert!)**
These mark where the author draws conclusions:

| Formal Conclusions | Causal Conclusions | Summary Conclusions |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Therefore | As a result | In summary |
| Thus | Consequently | Overall |
| Hence | Because of this | Ultimately |
| In conclusion | This leads to | On the whole |
| It follows that | This suggests | All things considered |

**Key Insight**: Main idea questions draw from sentences with these signals 70% of the time

#### **4. Certainty Indicators (Author Confidence)**

| High Certainty | Moderate Certainty | Low Certainty/Speculation |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Undoubtedly | Suggests | Might |
| Certainly | Indicates | Could |
| Clearly | Implies | Perhaps |
| Definitely | Appears | Possibly |
| Unquestionably | Seems | May |

**Strategic Value**: Determines whether something can be "strongly supported" vs. merely "suggested"

### Signal Word Practice Passage

<details>
<summary><b>Exercise: Map the Argument Flow</b></summary>

**Instructions**: Read this paragraph and identify all signals and what they indicate

"**Although** genetic testing promises to revolutionize personalized medicine, **critics argue** that the technology **might** create new forms of discrimination. **While** proponents **emphasize** the potential for targeted treatments, **skeptics point out** that insurance companies **could** use genetic information to deny coverage. **Nevertheless**, some bioethicists **maintain** that the benefits outweigh the risks, **suggesting** that proper regulation **can** address these concerns. **However**, this optimism **arguably** overlooks the history of medical discrimination. **Ultimately**, society **must** balance innovation with protection of vulnerable populations."

<details>
<summary><b>Expert Signal Analysis</b></summary>

**Argument Flow Map**:
1. "Although" → Concession (acknowledges promise)
2. "might" → Low certainty (speculation about discrimination)
3. "While" → Contrast (two positions presented)
4. "could" → Low certainty (possibility, not certainty)
5. "Nevertheless" → Strong contrast (shift to different view)
6. "suggesting" → Moderate certainty
7. "However" → Another shift (critiques the optimism)
8. "arguably" → Moderate certainty (debatable)
9. "Ultimately" → Conclusion signal
10. "must" → High certainty (author's firm position)

**Author's Journey**: Presents debate → Shows both sides → Reveals skepticism about easy solutions → Concludes with firm stance on need for balance
</details>
</details>

### Advanced Perspective Tracking

#### **The "Cast of Characters" Method**

For complex passages with multiple viewpoints:

```
PERSPECTIVE TRACKING TEMPLATE
├── Author's View: [Track throughout]
├── Expert/Researcher 1: [Name + position]
├── Expert/Researcher 2: [Name + position]
├── Critics/Opponents: [General position]
├── Historical View: [Past perspective]
└── Author's Final Stance: [Usually last paragraph]
```

#### **Common Perspective Traps**

| Trap | How to Recognize | Defense |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Expert = Author | Quotes without commentary | Look for author's evaluation words |
| First view = Author | Opening with someone else's claim | Author often critiques initial view |
| Strongest argument = Author | Compelling evidence presented | Check for "but" or "however" after |
| Last view = Author | Final paragraph has multiple views | Look for conclusion signals + certainty |

### Practice: Complex Perspective Tracking

<details>
<summary><b>Passage: The Consciousness Measurement Debate</b></summary>

Philosopher David Chalmers famously distinguished between the "easy problems" of consciousness—explaining cognitive functions—and the "hard problem"—explaining subjective experience itself. This distinction, while influential, has drawn criticism from materialists who argue it creates an artificial divide. Patricia Churchland dismisses the hard problem as a "hornets' nest of confusion," suggesting that neuroscience will eventually explain subjective experience just as it has explained other mental phenomena.

The 2025 Cogitate Consortium study attempted to test competing theories empirically. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) predicted specific patterns of neural integration during conscious experience, while Global Workspace Theory (GWT) emphasized widespread cortical activation. Neither theory's predictions were fully supported, leading some researchers to declare victory for the mysterian position—that consciousness may be fundamentally beyond human comprehension.

Yet neuroscientist Anil Seth offers a middle path. Rather than solving the hard problem directly, Seth proposes studying the "real problem"—how biological systems generate phenomenological properties. This pragmatic approach sidesteps philosophical debates while making empirical progress. Seth's predictive processing framework has shown promise in explaining perceptual consciousness, though critics note it still doesn't address why there is "something it is like" to perceive.

The debate's practical implications extend beyond philosophy. As artificial intelligence systems grow more sophisticated, determining whether they possess consciousness becomes urgent. If we cannot explain human consciousness, how can we evaluate machine consciousness? Perhaps, as philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel suggests, we need to accept consciousness as a cluster of related phenomena rather than a single mystery to be solved. This pluralistic approach might sacrifice theoretical elegance for practical progress—a trade-off that, given the stakes, seems increasingly reasonable.

**Track These Perspectives**:
1. Chalmers: ___________
2. Churchland: ___________
3. Mysterians: ___________
4. Seth: ___________
5. Schwitzgebel: ___________
6. Author: ___________

<details>
<summary><b>Expert Perspective Map</b></summary>

1. **Chalmers**: Consciousness has "hard problem" distinct from easy problems
2. **Churchland**: Dismisses hard problem as confusion; neuroscience will explain all
3. **Mysterians**: Consciousness fundamentally beyond human comprehension
4. **Seth**: Pragmatic "real problem" approach; study how biology creates experience
5. **Schwitzgebel**: Pluralistic view; consciousness as cluster not single mystery
6. **Author**: Sympathetic to pragmatic/pluralistic approaches; sees trade-off as "increasingly reasonable"

**Key Recognition Points**:
- Author doesn't appear until subtle evaluation words
- "Perhaps" in last paragraph signals author emerging
- "increasingly reasonable" reveals author's lean toward pragmatism
- Author presents all views fairly but subtly favors practical progress

## The 5-Step Question Method

### 🔬 **Why 5 Steps: The Science of Systematic Decision-Making**

**Evidence Base**: 
- High CARS scorers (128+) consistently report using systematic approaches
- Following structured steps reduces "attractive wrong answer" selection by 40-50%
- Systematic methods actually decrease time per question by preventing circular thinking

**Cognitive Psychology**: The method combats three decision-making biases:
1. **Anchoring**: First answer unduly influences choice
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeing what we expect in answers
3. **Satisficing**: Choosing "good enough" rather than best

### The Universal 5-Step Method

### Step-by-Step Mastery Guide

#### **Step 1: CATEGORIZE - Know Your Question Type**

**Why This Matters**: Different question types require different strategies. Misidentifying wastes time and leads to errors.

**The 10-Second Classification**:
- Is this asking for something STATED? → Foundation question
- Is this asking WHY/HOW within passage? → Reasoning Within
- Is this asking for NEW application? → Reasoning Beyond

**Quick Recognition Guide**:

| Foundation (30%) | Reasoning Within (30%) | Reasoning Beyond (40%) |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| "According to..." | "In order to..." | "Would most likely agree..." |
| "The passage states..." | "The purpose of X is..." | "Most similar situation..." |
| "The author's tone..." | "X relates to Y by..." | "If true, would support..." |
| "The main idea..." | "This example shows..." | "Applying this logic..." |

#### **Step 2: RESEARCH - Targeted Search**

**Why This Matters**: Unfocused re-reading wastes time and introduces confusion.

**Research Rules**:
1. For specific references → Go directly to that paragraph
2. For main idea → Check first and last paragraphs
3. For author opinion → Look after contrast signals
4. For relationships → Find both elements mentioned

**Efficiency Tip**: Most questions can be answered from memory if you read slowly initially. Research only for:
- Specific line references
- Detail verification
- Between two close choices

#### **Step 3: PREDICT - Your Defense Against Traps**

**Why This Matters**: Test writers design wrong answers to look attractive. Predicting protects against their persuasion.

**Prediction Templates**:
- Main idea: "The author argues [X] because [Y]"
- Function: "This example shows [concept]"
- Tone: "The author is [adjective] about [topic]"
- Application: "The author would view this as [evaluation]"

**Quality Check**: Your prediction should be:
- Specific enough to eliminate some choices
- General enough to match correct answer phrasing
- Based on passage evidence, not assumptions

#### **Step 4: ELIMINATE - The Power of Wrong Answer Recognition**

**Why This Matters**: Finding three wrong answers is often easier and more reliable than identifying the right one.

**Elimination Sequence**:
1. **Extreme language** (unless passage was extreme)
2. **Outside information** not in passage
3. **Opposite** of what passage said
4. **Close but wrong** (right info, wrong use)

**The 80/20 Rule**: 80% of wrong answers fall into these patterns:
- Too extreme/absolute
- Bring in outside info
- Contradict the passage
- Right fact, wrong context

#### **Step 5: VERIFY - Confirm Before Committing**

**Why This Matters**: Prevents last-second doubt and catches interpretation errors.

**Verification Standards**:
- Can you point to specific sentences?
- Does it fully answer what was asked?
- Is this what the AUTHOR thinks (not you)?
- Does it avoid adding outside ideas?

**Time Check**: If verification takes >10 seconds, you're overthinking. Trust your process.

### Integrated Practice Example

<details>
<summary><b>Full 5-Step Walkthrough</b></summary>

**Passage Excerpt**: "While artificial intelligence can process medical data faster than human physicians, the technology's inability to contextualize patient narratives or recognize subtle social cues limits its diagnostic utility. Dr. Chen's study found that AI systems missed 35% of diagnoses that required understanding patient lifestyle context."

**Question**: "The author mentions Dr. Chen's study primarily to:"

**Step 1 - Categorize** (3 seconds):
- "mentions...primarily to" = Function question
- This is Reasoning Within Text

**Step 2 - Research** (15 seconds):
- Located in context of AI limitations
- Follows claim about AI's contextual weakness
- Used as supporting evidence

**Step 3 - Predict** (10 seconds):
- "To provide evidence that AI misses diagnoses requiring context"
- Function: Support the limitation claim

**Step 4 - Eliminate** (25 seconds):

A) Argue that human doctors are superior to AI
- ❌ Too broad; passage is about specific limitations

B) Illustrate how AI's lack of contextual understanding affects diagnosis
- ✅ Matches prediction

C) Criticize Dr. Chen's research methodology
- ❌ No criticism present

D) Suggest all AI medical tools should be banned
- ❌ Extreme; not supported

**Step 5 - Verify** (5 seconds):
- B directly connects study to contextual limitation claim ✓
- Answers "why include this?" ✓
- Stays within passage scope ✓

**Total Time**: 58 seconds
</details>

### Common 5-Step Mistakes and Fixes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Skipping prediction | Rushing; overconfidence | Force 5-second pause before looking |
| Shallow elimination | Not identifying WHY wrong | Name the pattern out loud |
| Over-researching | Insecurity; perfectionism | 20-second limit on searching |
| Changing answers | Second-guessing process | Require new evidence to change |
| Adding outside knowledge | Subject expertise interfering | "Passage prison" mindset |

**3. Extreme Language (EX)**
- What: Too absolute/strong
- Why tempting: Feels decisive
- Defense: Look for "all," "never," "only," "must"
- Example: "Sometimes helpful" → "Always essential"

**4. Opposite/Negation (OPP)**
- What: Reverses passage meaning
- Why tempting: Contains right keywords
- Defense: Slow down for "not," "un-," "except"
- Example: "Unlike previous methods" → "Similar to"

#### **Tier 2: The Subtle Traps (25% of wrong answers)**

- Defense: Match scope to question ask
- Example: Paragraph detail for main idea question

**7. Distortion/Twist (DIST)**
- What: Subtle meaning change
- Why tempting: Uses passage language
- Defense: Focus on relationships
- Example: "Can lead to" → "Always causes"

**8. Wrong Viewpoint (WV)**

- Why tempting: Correct statement
- Defense: Reread what's asked
- Example: Answers different question

**11. Time Shift (TS)**
- What: Confuses chronology
- Why tempting: Events mentioned together
- Defense: Track temporal markers
- Example: Past presented as future

**12. Correlation/Causation (CC)**
- What: Upgrades relationship
- Why tempting: Things appear connected
- Defense: Check exact relationship
- Example: "Associated" → "Causes"

**13. Emotional Appeal (EA)**
- What: Triggers feelings not in passage
- Why tempting: Seems morally right
- Defense: Author's view, not yours
- Example: What "should" be vs. what is

### Reasoning Within the Text (30%)

#### **What These Really Test**
- Understanding relationships
- Recognizing function of examples
- Analyzing argument structure
- Identifying author's methods

#### **Time Allocation**: 45-75 seconds per question

#### **Recognition Phrases**
- "The author mentions X in order to..."
- "The relationship between X and Y is..."
- "This example serves to..."
- "Which would strengthen/weaken..."
- "The purpose of paragraph 3 is..."

#### **Strategic Approach**

```
REASONING WITHIN STRATEGY
├── Focus on FUNCTION not content
├── Ask "Why is this here?"
├── Connect to larger argument
├── Track logical flow
└── Verify relationships
```

#### **Key Question Types**

**Function Questions**:
- Ask: "What job does this detail do?"
- Answer describes purpose, not content
- Common functions: Support claim, provide example, show contrast, introduce topic

**Strengthen/Weaken Questions**:
- Need NEW evidence of same type
- Systematic evidence > anecdotes
- Must be substantial, not speculative
- Watch for correlation vs. causation

### Reasoning Beyond the Text (40%)

#### **What These Really Test**
- Applying passage logic to new scenarios
- Predicting author's views
- Finding analogous situations
- Evaluating implications

#### **Time Allocation**: 60-90 seconds per question

#### **Recognition Phrases**
- "The author would most likely agree..."
- "Which situation is most analogous..."
- "Based on the passage, which follows..."
- "Applying the author's logic..."
- "If the author's argument is correct..."

#### **Strategic Approach**

```
REASONING BEYOND STRATEGY
├── Extract underlying principle
├── Strip away surface details  
├── Maintain author's perspective
├── Apply logic structure
└── Verify consistency
```

#### **Advanced Techniques**

**Application Questions**:
1. Identify the core pattern in passage
2. Look for same pattern, different content
3. Match logical structure, not topic

**Analogy Questions**:
- Same relationship, different domain
- Focus on: Actor → Action → Result
- Ignore surface similarities

**Author Agreement**:
1. List 3 things author definitely believes
2. Note 2 things author opposes
3. Predict stance before reading choices
4. Choose consistent with established views

### Question Type Quick Reference

| Type | % of Test | Time | Key Strategy | Common Error |
|------|-----------|------|--------------|--------------|
| Foundations | 30% | 30-45s | Trust first read | Overthinking |
| Within Text | 30% | 45-75s | Function focus | Content over purpose |
| Beyond Text | 40% | 60-90s | Apply principles | Losing author view |

## Timing Framework

### 🔬 **The Science of Sustainable Pacing**

**Evidence Base**:
- Cognitive performance degrades after 60+ minutes of complex reading
- Strategic micro-breaks (even 10 seconds) can restore processing capacity
- Rushing increases error rate disproportionately to time saved

**The Reality**: You have 90 minutes for 9 passages = 10 minutes each. This is tight but manageable with proper strategy.

### The Optimal 10-Minute Breakdown

```
PASSAGE TIMING BLUEPRINT
├── Topic Preview: 5 seconds
├── Reading Phase: 3-4 minutes
│   ├── Adjust by ±30 seconds for density
│   └── Never below 3 minutes
├── Question Phase: 5-6 minutes
│   ├── Foundations: 30-45 seconds
│   ├── Within Text: 45-75 seconds
│   └── Beyond Text: 60-90 seconds
└── Reset/Transition: 20-30 seconds
```

### Critical Timing Principles

**1. Front-Load Comprehension**
- 4-minute read → 1-2 passage returns
- 2-minute skim → 5-7 passage returns
- Time "saved" is lost in confusion

**2. Question Time Limits**
- Hard limit at 90 seconds per question
- If stuck between two at 60 seconds, pick and move
- Flag for review if time allows (rarely worth it)

**3. The 30-Second Reset**
```
Between passages:
├── Look away (5 sec)
├── Deep breath (5 sec)
├── Clear mind (10 sec)
└── Preview next (10 sec)
```

### Pacing Checkpoints

| Time | Target | Warning Sign | Action |
|------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 20:00 | Finishing passage 2 | >2 min behind | Don't reduce reading |
| 45:00 | Starting passage 5 | >3 min behind | Strict question limits |
| 70:00 | Starting passage 8 | <20 min left | Consider strategic choice |

### When You're Behind

**DON'T**:
- Reduce reading below 3 minutes
- Skip passages
- Abandon your strategy
- Panic

**DO**:
- Maintain reading quality
- Set strict question time limits
- Guess quickly between final two
- Trust your preparation

### Building Time Intuition

**Week 1-2**: Use timer alerts
**Week 3-4**: Check at passage 3, 6, 9 only
**Week 5-6**: Develop internal sense
**Week 7+**: Natural pacing without checking

## Daily Practice Routines

### 🔬 **Why Daily Practice: The Compound Effect**

**Evidence**: 
- Daily practice (even 20 minutes) outperforms weekly marathons
- Neural pathways strengthen through consistent repetition
- Skills degrade after 3+ days without practice
- Morning practice shows better retention than evening

### The Minimum Effective Dose (20-30 minutes)

```
OPTION A: MORNING FOCUS
├── Signal word hunt in news (5 min)
├── One CARS passage (10 min)
├── Error analysis (5-10 min)
└── Strategy note for tomorrow (5 min)

OPTION B: SPLIT SESSION  
Morning (10 min):
├── Perspective tracking exercise
└── Wrong answer pattern review

Evening (15 min):
├── One timed passage
└── Deep review
```

### The Standard Protocol (45-60 minutes)

```
DAILY CARS WORKOUT
├── Warm-up (10 min)
│   ├── Review yesterday's errors
